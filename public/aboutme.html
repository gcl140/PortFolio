            <b>Jackson:</b> Yo! Zawadi (Swahili for Gift)
            <br>
            <br>
            I turned to him with the one-minute angry face I usually gave anyone calling me by that name.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Jackson</b> (while laughing): Stop it; I just wanted you to come with me to Funcity this Saturday before
            our 6th
            grade graduation. I’m paying.
            <br>
            <br>
            My face cherished immediately.
            <br>
            <b>Gift:</b> Now you’re talking! Okay, but don’t call me by that name again, it’s girlish.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Jackson:</b> But it’s your name right?
            <br>
            <br>
            I always lacked words to defend myself after such shots were fired.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="hi2">
            The day arrived, and so did we at Funcity. Every swing attracted me, but Jackson insisted that we go for the
            waters. It didn’t take long for swimming to bore us. However, a slide coming from all the way up, through a
            spiral tube, then out into the kid’s pool we were in, was intriguing. We went to try it out, though with
            hesitation. On the way, I noticed stairs advancing higher than the slide we were going to. But I went on to
            my slide and felt so satisfied on arriving down the pool in one piece, that I was compelled to try out the
            tallest slide.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="hi2">


            So I went up to try it out, and there, I noticed that it was the peak of Fun City, and the slide went down
            into a different pool.


            Unluckily, while sliding down, water splashed vigorously on my face, causing me to lose grip on the sliding
            mat. In the end, I arrived down yes, but now, not in one piece. One piece felt missing, but I wasn’t certain
            which, until Jackson started laughing at me. Half of my front tooth had broken off. Together with diastema,
            the gap seen was like a two-teeth gap. Catalyzed with my name, Zawadi,

        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="hi2">
            I became a trend at school—they called Zawadi to intrigue me to reply back just so they could burst into
            laughter on seeing my teeth gap.


            Just like my name, this tooth was a part of my identity that I refused to live with. I tried different
            talking styles to hide it, but none worked. Eventually, I visited a dentist who filled it with artificial
            enamel. Though not as perfect as before, it was better than how it was an hour ago.


            This transformation burdened me with extended tooth care and restrictions from eating my favorite



        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="hi2">

            foods like sugarcane. But despite all these efforts, the tooth only got browner with time, and sent me back
            to hiding it. “Just to hide my identity? Where did that get me”, I pondered in regret.


            Subsequently, I vowed that my name shouldn’t follow this tragic path with all the nicknames and policies I
            employed. I resolved to embrace my personalities, starting with my Zawadi name. Graciously thereafter, I
            realized my name’s potential for not only me, but most importantly and as it is famous for, for others.
            Supporting others was always an act I cherished.
